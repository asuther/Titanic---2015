    "# Plan for combining models using stacked generalization\n",
    "\n",
    "After reading \"Ensemble selection with Libraries...\" I found that another method of generating stacked predictors is to generate a large diversity of models and then combining them to minimize a probe set error. The general flow would be as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Train >100 different model on a training set\n",
    "2. Generate predictions for a probe set and store these along with the model parameters in a csv\n",
    "3. Load the predictions as a design matrix\n",
    "4. Run a logistic regression model with a starting model and an added model\n",
    "5. Repeat this for the starting model + every other model, store each combinations' probe error\n",
    "6. Select the model that minimizes the error\n",
    "7. Test the new combination of models on a test set\n",
    "8. Plot the probe and test set error as a function of # of models blended"
